## What is that ?

This repo contains all the official, recognised open source licenses designed by Oph√©lien "Shalien" DUPARC" and it's association (French law 1901) "Projetretro".

## Why ?

Beacause "Dura lex, sed lex" (The law is harsh, but it is the law) and because all other open source licenses didn't match their needs.

By writing their own licenses, they can be sure that their work will be used as they want it to be used even if this would be at the cost of some freedom.

For example, the licenses, even the most permissive ones, forbid the use of their works in any kind of commmercial product, even if the product has a free and open source version. It also prevent the use of their works in any kind of product and/or protocol and/or services related to AI and/or machine learning.


## How to use ?

All the licenses can be found in the `licenses` folder.

There's three levels of licenses:
- `licenses/open` contains the most permissive licenses
- `licenses/restricted` contains the licenses that are a bit less permissive
- `licenses/closed` contains the least permissive licenses

You can use and copy the licenses as you want, and add your own name and/or association name to the license.

You can also use the licenses as a base to create your own license, but you must change the name of the license to include the base licence used and your name and/or association name.

For example :
```
PROJETRETRO RESTRICTED LICENSE (PRL) + YOUR NAME
```

While doing so, it's imperative that you keep the base license text entirely and that you add your own text after it in a clearly defined section. Your addition can't alter the meaning of the base license in any way.

You can't also relicense a work under an extended version of the license. For example, you can't relicense a work under the PRL+ if it was originally licensed under the PRL.
